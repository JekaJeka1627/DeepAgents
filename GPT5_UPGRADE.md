# ðŸš€ GPT-5 Now Available in DeepAgents!

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Update: GPT-5 Integration

DeepAgents now supports GPT-5, the latest and most advanced AI model from OpenAI! 

### âš¡ Immediate Benefits

- **Default Model**: DeepAgents now uses GPT-5 by default (upgraded from GPT-4o-mini)
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified, 88% on Aider polyglot
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Built-in reasoning capabilities for complex problems
- **Massive Context**: 256K token context window (can process entire codebases)
- **Multimodal**: Advanced text, code, and image processing

### ðŸ¤– Available GPT-5 Variants

| Model | Best For | Cost | Performance |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| **gpt-5** | Complex reasoning, architecture decisions | Higher | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **gpt-5-mini** | General development, balanced performance | Medium | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **gpt-5-nano** | Quick queries, batch processing | Low | â˜…â˜…â˜… |
| **gpt-5-chat-latest** | Conversational AI, dialogue | Higher | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |

### ðŸ’» New Commands

```bash
# See all GPT-5 variants and pricing
/model list

# Switch to GPT-5 Mini for cost-effectiveness  
/model set gpt-5-mini

# View performance benchmarks
/model benchmark

# See cost comparisons
/model costs

# Compare features across models
/model features
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations

- **For Daily Development**: `gpt-5-mini` (great balance of performance and cost)
- **For Complex Analysis**: `gpt-5` (maximum reasoning capability)
- **For Batch Operations**: `gpt-5-nano` (cost-effective for simple tasks)

### ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. **Automatic**: DeepAgents now uses GPT-5 by default - nothing to configure!
2. **Custom Model**: Use `/model set <model-name>` to switch variants
3. **Environment Variable**: Set `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini` for persistent preference

### ðŸ“Š Performance Improvements

With GPT-5, you'll notice:
- **Better Code Analysis**: More accurate bug detection and suggestions
- **Smarter Workflows**: Enhanced reasoning in automated workflows  
- **Deeper Context**: Can understand and work with much larger codebases
- **Specialized Agents**: More expert-level responses from domain agents

### ðŸ’° Cost Management

- GPT-5 Mini offers 80% of GPT-5's performance at 20% of the cost
- Use `/model costs` to see detailed pricing for each variant
- DeepAgents will help you choose the right model for each task
